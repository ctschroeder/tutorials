## About Omeka

Omeka is one of the most popular programs designed to create digital archives. Programmers, academics, and librarians at George Mason University created it and maintain it. 

Some of the sites you visited in class for this unit used Omeka!

The creators of Omeka maintain robust [documentation for Omeka online](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/).  You can also visit an online [showcase of projects using Omeka](https://omeka.org/classic/showcase/).


## 1. Find at least THREE archives to add to our archive of archives

In this unit of our course, we are talking a lot about digital archives. For this assignment, we will be collaboratively contributing to a digital archive of archives. So, the digital Shelley-Godwin Archives we studied collected digitized papers by Shelley and Godwin. Our Archive of Archives will collect other digital archives.

Find at least THREE archives you want to include. Maybe it's a physical archive. Maybe it's a fictional archive (like the Star Wars Imperial archive). Maybe it's a digital archive. Whatever you want.

At least TWO archives must be something new -- not something on the syllabus for the course.

You can add a web link to digital archive, a photograph of a physical archive, or just enter a physical or fictional archive without a link or photo.

## 2. Watch the videos

If you've never used Omeka, [watch this Introduction to Omeka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tii2aL7cMBE) created by the Duke University Wired! Lab. **It's only 5 minutes: watch it!**

* Do you understand what an Item is?  

* Do you understand what metadata is? 

* Do you understand what Omeka is?

Great! Now watch [this video about the Omeka Dashboard](https://youtu.be/PNOkRyrJ4WI).  **It's only a few minutes: watch it!**

* Do you know how to login?

* Do you know what the menu is?

No? rewatch or come to Dr. S's Student hours.

Yes?  Great! Now [watch this video about adding content to Omeka](https://youtu.be/jeWFIRbMEN8)! **It's longer but it will help you!! You can pause and restart as you work through the rest of the tutorial if you'd like!!**

* Do you know what a Collection is?

* Do you know how to add an Item?

## 3. Consider what kind of item you have (item Types in Omeka)

Each of the archives you picked out in **Step 1** is an "Item."  You will add each "Item" to our archive of archives.

Consider what KIND of Item your archive is:
- is it a physical place (a real archives, like the National Archives in Washington DC)?
- are you adding a photograph of of the archive?
- is it a website?

Omeka is going to ask you to classify each item as a TYPE. Read the following and WRITE DOWN what item Type(S) you have for your three Itmes:
- give a physical place the Physical Object type
- give a photograph a Still Image type
- give a website a Website Type

## 4. Add your items to our Omeka site

**NOTE: if at any point you get confused:**

 * **Consult the [video listed above in Step 2 on adding content to Omeka](https://youtu.be/jeWFIRbMEN8)**
 
 * **still confused? move on and come back later**
 
 * **still confused? come see me in my Zoom student hours; I'll walk you through it!**
 
Ok here we go:

 * Login at the site (check your email !!):  login is the site URL + /admin added at the end.

 * Click on Items and Add New Item

 * Add the appropriate metadata (and files) under the four tabs that appear across the top of your Add an Item Page

### Dublin Core Tab

Dublin Core is a metadata standard librarians use to describe items in a Library or Archive; [if you want more info, Omeka has it](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Content/Working_with_Dublin_Core/#why-dublin-core))

Fill out the boxes that appear under this tab

   * Title: what is the title of the archive?

   * Subject: is the subject of the archive literature, art, photography, graffiti, government documents, etc.?
   
   * Description: EITHER describe the object in your own words OR copy a description from the archive itself: copy and paste, put the description in quotes, and add a link to the site with the description you copied

   * Creator: is there someone who took the photograph? designed the digital archive? founded the physical archive? if not leave blank

   * Source: where did you find this? if it's a Website, put the URL; if a digital image, list the source of the image; if no source leave blank

   * Publisher: who made this archive available? (If it's a physical place, leave it blank; if it's digital, is there a library/university/other larger institution that is responsible for publishing the digital archive?

   * Date: you can leave this blank unless you have a photograph or website that has a clear date; if you have a clear date enter it as YYYY-MM-DD or just YYYY for year

   * Contributor: YOU! Your name!

   * Rights:  Unless you know what this is, leave blank for now -- we will come back to rights later in the semester
     
   * Relation (OPTIONAL): leave blank for now

   * Format: what is the format of the object? for Physical Object and Website leave blank; for photograph enter jpg, tiff, png or whatever format your digital photo file is in. (Leave blank if this confuses you!)

   * Language (for items with text only): what language is the archive? (leave blank if you don't know)

   * Type: not the same as an "Item Type". What kind of archive is this?

   * Identifier: leave blank for now

   * Coverage: if this is a Physical Object or a Still Image of a physical archives, put the geographic location of the archive; otherwise leave blank
 
### Item Type Metadata

   * Choose a Type (Physical object, Still image, or Website are your likely answers)

   * Fill out remaining boxes if at all possible

### Files 

This is where you upload a file if you are providing a file.  (You do not need a file for a Website or Physical Object. You DO need a file for a Still Image.) 

### Tags

* Enter tags like you do on a blog

* Separate them with a comma

* Spell correctly and use capitalization only for proper names

* Be sure to click Add Tags when you're done entering them

### Right-hand box that says Add Item, Public or Featured, & Collection

  * Click on Public so the world can see your item

  * Donâ€™t click featured; this is where you would tell Omeka "show this image on the front page where everyone can see it". I'll pick a featured item later.

  * Collections are groups of items. **I have already added some Collections.** Pick the collection that fits your item the best!
  
    * Physical archives: choose this collection if you have a still image, website, or physical object that is or represents a Physical Archive in the real world
    
    * Fictional archives: choose this collection if you have a still image, website, or physical object that is or represents a Fictional Archive, an archive that exists only on TV, in the movies, in a book, etc.
    
    * Digital archives: choose this collection if you have a still image, website, or physical object that is or represents a Digital Archive online
    
  **Note:  you can have different Item Types in some Collections. So you might have an entry for a Physical Object and an entry for a Still Image both in the Phyisical Archive collection.  The Physical Object is an actual archive in the world. The Still Image is a photograph of an actual archive in the world.**

### Click the big ADD ITEM button

## 5. Review your item

 * Click on Items in the left menu bar.
 
 * Click on your item.
 
 * Click View Public Page.
   
   * Review the metadata, the file information, tags, collection, etc.  

   * Check for accuracy and spelling and whether something is missing
   
   * Do the links work?
   
 * Go back to the item page and click Edit if you need to fix anything
 
 ## 6. Go back and [redo Steps 4-5](https://github.com/ctschroeder/tutorials/blob/master/add-omeka-items.md#4-add-your-items-to-our-omeka-site) for each additional Item.
 
 ## 7. Go to the public site and look for your Items
 
 Go to the public site for this assignment. 
 
 * Click on "Browse Collections": check the Collections to be sure your items are there.
 
   * Yes? AWESOME you're done.

     * Yes? Edit them to add each of them to the correct Collection. Be sure to Save!!
     
     * No? Edit them and be sure you 1) clicked the Public button so everyone can see your Items, and 2) selected a Collection. Be sure to Save!!
