** OU maintains a robust set of [support documents](https://create.ou.edu/docs/) including a LONG tutorial for [setting up your WordPress site](https://create.ou.edu/docs/web-apps/wordpress/). 

This tutorial focuses on the BARE MINIMUM you need to do to set up a basic WordPress site for **my course**, before adding a lot of content.

### 1. The WordPress Dashboard

The Dashboard is where you give WordPress all of its instructions on how to display your site.  You should be familiar with it, because you probably have already used it in a Private Student Blog or Discussion Site in the course already.

To get to your dashboard, you go to your domain with /wp-admin/ tacked on to the end.  So if your OU Create (sub)domain is imsocool.oucreate.com, you would go to https://imsocool.oucreate.com/wp-admin/

### 2. Title

Go to Settings > General on your dashboard. Once you’re on the General Settings page, you can give your blog any title you want. You can also give your blog a tagline, which can be a short description of the blog.

When you change the Blog title and tag line, they will show up at the top of your site. Depending on what theme you use, the title and tag lines will show up in various places. In the case of some themes, they might not show up at all depending on whether they allow custom configurations. We won’t worry about that for now.

### 3. Themes

The look and layout of your WordPress site is determined by the Theme.  There are a MILLION themes for WordPress. The OU Create documentation page about [setting up your WordPress site](https://create.ou.edu/docs/web-apps/wordpress/) has a section on WordPress Themes with pictures!!!

When you install WordPress, the default (or pre-set) theme is called [Twenty Twenty](https://wordpress.org/support/article/twenty-twenty/) (as of WordPress version 5.3). It is a very customizable theme. You can easily modify the colors of the different fonts and backgrounds used in the theme and even choose between different templates for each page.

To pick a different theme and activate a theme go to Appearance > Themes in your dashboard.  You will see thumbnail images representing each of the themes that you currently have available on your site. Simply mouse over any one of them, and click the Activate link.

**Note: You don't have to install a new theme immediately. If you're new to this it's perfectly ok to stick with the Twenty Twenty Theme!!!**

If you don't like the themes you see, you can install a new one. (Our course site uses the theme Gutenix.)

- Navigate to Appearance > Themes. 
- Click the Add New Button
- Hover over each theme, and you'll see options to Install, Preview, and Details & Preview. Click Install to add a new theme to your site.
- You can search for themes based on features, and you can also see what themes are popular. Look at the little menu that says Featured Popular Latest Feature Filter on the top.
- Once you've installed a theme you need to ACTIVATE it before it will show on your site.  You should see a link to Activate after Wordpress has downloaded and installed. You an also navigate to Appearance > Themes in your Dashboard and activate it from there.

### 4. Pages and Posts

There are two basic kinds of content for Wordpress: Pages (your basic web page) and Posts (Blog posts that appear on a blog, like the News page of the course website.)

You will need to choose if you want your Home page for your site to be your blog roll or a web page. Advantage of a blog -- all your new content appears right away. Advantage of a Page -- information about who you are, what the site is is always there; you can add links to your latest posts in a separate area of a Page called a Widget. We will talk about those later!!!. **You can always change your mind later, so just pick one for now!!!**

If you choose a Page for your Home, then you want to be sure you *have* a page to show. 
- On your Dashboard Navigate to Pages. 
- You will see any sample pages your theme may have for you
- Play around with a sample page or create a new one by clicking on New
- Creating a Page is a lot like a Post -- you should be familiar with this from the Student Blog/Discussion Page

### 5. Customize your theme

Depending on your Theme, there are different ways to customize. Your Theme has a built-in little tutorial to walk you through Customization.
