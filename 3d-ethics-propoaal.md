## 1. About Cultural Heritage Scanning

As we are studying in this unit, scanning historical and cultural heritage objects can help research on those objects, because you can study them closely without having to touch them or move them or move TO them.  As we have studied, there are also some ethical issues to consider.

## 2. Learn about 3D Scanning at OU

In this tutorial, you'll select an object for scanning and explain why it should be scanned.  First, familiarize yourself with scanning at OU by reviewing the [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/ctschroeder/tutorials/blob/master/other-files/3D%20Scanning%20at%20OU%20Libraries%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf)
