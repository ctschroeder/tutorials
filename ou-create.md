## Registering a domain/subdomain at OU Create ##
This tutorial lives online (with live links) at https://github.com/ctschroeder/tutorials/blob/master/ou-create.md.

**Registering your domain name.**

1. BEFORE you do, read about:
   - [privacy](https://create.ou.edu/docs/web-security/privacy-and-create-ou/)
   - [selecting a domain name](https://create.ou.edu/docs/getting-started/choosing-a-domain-name/)

2. Go to https://create.ou.edu

3. Click “Get Started” or “Login” 

4. Follow the directions to register your domain name or your subdomain  
REMEMBER to think about your web presence.  
Advantages to using your name: you can be found/digital identity.  (Though even if you don't use your name, you can make your name the title so you can be found.)
Pick things that reflect WELL on you professionally for your domain name, if you decide to keep this website after this class.

**Setting up your website AT your domain**
Once your Domain or Subdomain (the web URL) is registered, you need to set up a website.  If you know web programming, you can use whatever system you like.  If you don’t, I recommend you use WordPress, which is the dominant content management system on the web.  (If you want you can [read more about web applications](https://create.ou.edu/docs/web-apps/what-exactly-is-a-web-application/)). 
1.	Click on CPanel once you’ve logged into create.ou.edu
2.	You should see a panel with a lot of applications.  When you get to that panel, click on WordPress, and then click on “Install this application” 
3.	You should get to a window with the Installatron install wizard:
If you are using WordPress for your main website:  **make sure the DOMAIN is your website, and DIRECTORY is BLANK. You may need to delete “blog” from DIRECTORY.**
 
On the same page, scroll down to SETTINGS.   
Tell Wordpress:
  - The login username you want for your website.  
      - (This is different from your OU Create login which uses your 4x4).  OU Create is your webhosting service provider.  create.ou.edu is where you manage your account.  When you install software on your website, you will login to that software to update your website, just like you do to post to the class blog. (See https://create.ou.edu/docs/web-security/accounts-passwords/ for more details):
  - The login password
  - Check the email address is correct
  - Your website’s title (you can change this later)
  - Your website’s slogan or tagline  (not required/you can change this later)
  - YES limit login attempts (this ensures bots can’t attack your site)
  - NO do not enable multisite (unless you already have plans to set up multiple websites using WordPress!)
  - Make sure everything on this page is as you like it and click INSTALL.

You will get to a page that tells you the web address of your website and the web address to administer it.  
This should look like http://whateveryoupickedforyourdomainname.com and http://whateveryoupickedforyourdomainname.com/wp-admin 

Click on the admin address (with wp-admin) and Customize your site!!
