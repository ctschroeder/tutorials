## About Omeka

Omeka is one of the most popular programs designed to create digital archives. Programmers, academics, and librarians at George Mason University created it and maintain it. 

Many of the sites you visited in class used Omeka!

The creators of Omeka maintain robust [documentation for Omeka online](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/).  You can also visit an online [showcase of projects using Omeka](https://omeka.org/classic/showcase/).


## 1. Find at the required number and type of items to add to our online archive & exhibit

Your class assignment instructions will tell you how many items to add and what type of item.

Find the required number of objects 
  - Be sure you can authenticate the item -- is the source reliable, why? 
  - Do you have permission to use the item in our exhibit? What is the license -- is there one? Is there some other statement?
  - Bookmark, save, make notes on your items

Again: be sure to review the specific assignment instructions for requirements.

## 2. Optional: Watch the videos

If you've never used Omeka, [watch this Introduction to Omeka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tii2aL7cMBE) created by the Duke University Wired! Lab. **It's only 5 minutes: watch it!**

* Do you understand what an Item is?  

* Do you understand what metadata is? 

* Do you understand what Omeka is?

Great! Now watch [this video about the Omeka Dashboard](https://youtu.be/PNOkRyrJ4WI).  **It's only a few minutes: watch it!**

* Do you know how to login?

* Do you know what the menu is?

No? rewatch or come to Dr. S's Student hours.

Yes?  Great! Now [watch this video about adding content to Omeka](https://youtu.be/jeWFIRbMEN8)! **It's longer but it will help you!! You can pause and restart as you work through the rest of the tutorial if you'd like!!**

* Do you know what a Collection is?

* Do you know how to add an Item?

## 3. In class: in your groups, share the three things you brought to class:

 - Each person describe one Item, then go around two more times

 - Think about whether or not there are logical Collections to which you could add your items, or whether you need to create new Collections.  

   * WRITE down possible Collection names – we will discuss as a class

   * Keep in mind 

      * the readings about Classification (how we classify things tells us about the meaning we ascribe to them)

      * the exercise we did classifying everyday objects 

      * the reading on Metadata we discussed

## 4. Add one item from each person to our Omeka site

**NOTE: if at any point you get confused:**

 * **Consult the [video listed above in Step 2 on adding content to Omeka](https://youtu.be/jeWFIRbMEN8)**
 
 * **still confused? move on and come back later**
 
 * **still confused? come see me in my Zoom student hours; I'll walk you through it!**
 
Ok here we go:

 * Login at the site (check your email, including junk/spam folder!!):  login is the site URL + /admin added at the end.

 * Click on Items and Add New Item

 * Add the appropriate metadata (and files) under the four tabs that appear across the top of your Add an Item Page

### Dublin Core Tab

Dublin Core is a metadata standard librarians use to describe items in a Library or Archive; [if you want more info, Omeka has it](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Content/Working_with_Dublin_Core/#why-dublin-core))

Fill out the boxes that appear under this tab

   * Title: what is the title of your object?

   * Subject: is the subject of the object
   
   * Description: EITHER describe the object in your own words OR copy a description from your source itself. If you copy and paste, put the description in quotes, and add a link to the site with the description you copied

   * Creator: is there someone who took the photograph, created the object, designed the building, etc.? if not leave blank

   * Source: where did you find this? if it's a Website, put the URL; if a digital image, list the source of the image; if no source leave blank

   * Publisher: who made this archive available? (If it's a physical place, leave it blank; if it's digital, is there a library/university/other larger institution that is responsible for publishing the digital archive?

   * Date: you can leave this blank unless you have a photograph or website that has a clear date; if you have a clear date enter it as YYYY-MM-DD or just YYYY for year
      * If your object is a photograph of an object, you may wish to include the date of the image (also called a surrogate) as one entry and the date of the original object as another entry. If so, click “Add Input” to add a second entry box.

   * Contributor: YOU! Your name!

   * Rights: use the license the ORIGINAL source uses; it will probably be some form of Creative Commons (CC). Type in the license and link to the CC website for the license
     
   * Relation (OPTIONAL): leave blank for now

   * Format: what is the format of the object? (Leave blank if this confuses you!)

   * Language (for items with text only)

   * Type: what kind of resource; if your item is a photograph of something else, click Add Input to add a second box; you can have an entry for the photograph/surrogate and an entry for the thing being photographed

   * Identifier: leave blank for now; we have not created identifiers for our project

   * Coverage: if this is a Physical Object or a Still Image of a physical archives, put the geographic location of the archive; otherwise leave blank
 
### Item Type Metadata

   * Choose a Type (Physical object, Still image, or Website are your likely answers)

   * Fill out remaining boxes if at all possible

### Files 

This is where you upload a file if you are providing a file.  (You do not need a file for a Website or Physical Object. You DO need a file for a Still Image.) 

### Tags

* Enter tags like you do on a blog

* Separate them with a comma

* Spell correctly and use capitalization only for proper names

* Be sure to click Add Tags when you're done entering them

### Right-hand box that says Add Item, Public or Featured, & Collection

  * Click on Public so the world can see your item

  * Don’t click featured; this is where you would tell Omeka "show this image on the front page where everyone can see it". I'll pick a featured item later.

  * Collections are groups of items. **I will try to add some Collections in class based on our conversation.** Pick the collection that fits your item the best!
    
  * Save changes

***HELP EACH OTHER OUT***

***Click the big ADD ITEM button***

## 5. Review your item

Each person in the group should review someone else’s item – review the metadata, the file information, tags, collection, etc.

* Click on Items in the left menu bar.
 
 * Click on the item you are reviewing.
 
 * Click View Public Page.
   
   * Review the metadata, the file information, tags, collection, etc.  

   * Check for accuracy and spelling and whether something is missing
   
   * Do the links work?
   
 * Tell the creator of the item
 
 * On your own item that someone else reviewed, click Edit and make necessary changes.
 
 ## 6. Go back and [redo Steps 4-5](https://github.com/ctschroeder/tutorials/blob/master/add-omeka-items.md#4-add-your-items-to-our-omeka-site) for your each additional Item.
 
 ## 7. Go to the public site and look for your Items
 
 Go to the public site for this assignment. 
 
 * Click on "Browse Collections": check the Collections to be sure your items are there.
 
   * Yes? AWESOME you're done.
   
   * No? Click on "Browse Items". Do you see your two items?
   
     * Yes? Edit them to add each of them to the correct Collection. Be sure to Save!!
     
     * No? Edit them and be sure you 1) clicked the Public button so everyone can see your Items, and 2) selected a Collection. Be sure to Save!!
     
   * Go back to "Browse Collections" on the public page. You should see your items in their Collections now!
