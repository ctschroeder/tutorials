## 1. Find at least three objects pertaining to the text

In class we all read a text that will be the basis of our Omeka exhibit(s). (For 2020, the Martyrdoms of Perpetua and Felicitas).

Find at least three objects that will help you address the questions and issues we discussed in class about the text.
  - Be sure you can authenticate the item -- is the source reliable, why? 
  - Do you have permission to use the item in our exhibit? What is the license -- is there one? Is there some other statement?
  - Bookmark, save, make notes on your items

## 2. In your groups, share the three things you brought to class:

 - Each person describe one Item, then go around two more times

 - Think about whether or not there are logical Collections to which you could add your items, or whether you need to create new Collections.  

   * WRITE down possible Collection names – we will discuss as a class

   * Keep in mind 

 * the readings about Classification (how we classify things tells us about the meaning we ascribe to them)

 * the exercise we did classifying everyday objects 

 * the reading on Metadata we discussed



## 3. Add ONE item from each person to our Omeka site

 * Login at the site (check your email/class syllabus/Canvas:  login is the site URL + /admin added at the end.

 * Click on Items and Add New Item

 * Be sure to put the item in an appropriate Collection.  (If an appropriate Collection is not online yet, come back later and edit your item.)

 * Add the appropriate metadata (and files) under the following tabs:

   * Dublin Core (this is a metadata standard librarians use)

     * Title

     * Subject

     * Description

     * Creator

     * Source

     * Publisher

     * Date (You may wish to include both the date of the image/surrogate AND the date of an object if you have an object such as a sculpture or ruins; if so, click “Add Input” to add a second entry box)

     * Contributor (this would be the name(s) of the student(s) adding the Item)

     * Rights (use the license the ORIGINAL source uses; it will probably be some form of Creative Commons (CC). Type in the license and link to the CC website for the license)

     * Relation (OPTIONAL)

     * Format

     * Language (for items with text only)

     * Type (what kind of resource; if your item is a photograph of something else, click Add Input to add a second box; you can have an entry for the photograph/surrogate and an entry for the thing being photographed)

     * Identifier (we have not created Identifiers)

     * Coverage (Optional)

   * Item Type Metadata

     * Choose a Type

     * Fill out remaining boxes if at all possible

* Files 

  * this is where you upload a file if you are providing a file.  If your object has more than one file, you can upload multiple

  * Tags (give your item tags; spell correctly and use capitalization only for proper names, e.g. Perpetua, arena, etc.)

  * Click on Public on the right so the world can see your item

  * Don’t click featured – we’ll decide as a class on Featured items later

  * Select a Collection.  If there is not an appropriate Collection, make a note and bring it to the class discussion.

* SAVE CHANGES

***HELP EACH OTHER OUT.***

### 4. Review

 * Each person in the group should review someone else’s item – review the metadata, the file information, tags, collection, etc.  

 * Check for accuracy and spelling and whether something is missing

 * Check for consistency

If time:  discuss your other potential items.  Look at the list of Item Types to get ideas for possible things you could add to the site.  Do you still want to put your other 2 on our site?  Do you want to look for different items?
