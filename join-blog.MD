### About the Private Blog ###

For almost all my courses, I use Wordpress as the software for creating a blog.  Why Wordpress?  Well, it's pretty easy, and it's ubiquitous on the web. Knowing how to create a good website in Wordpress will get you a long way toward having a strong presence on the web for yourself.

The course blog is *private*, using a plugin called My Private Site.  This plugin ensures that only authorized users can read the blog (much less contribute to it). So your class discussion conversations are private within our class community only.

I will delete the blog entirely after the semester ends.

### Joining the Blog ###

1. Check your OU email inbox for an invitation from WORDPRESS to the private course blog.  If you don’t see it, look in your junk/spam folder.

1. Click on the FIRST link to register and change your password. **NOTE: IF YOU DON’T SEE THE EMAIL go to the link for the blog on your course page and click “forgot your password?”. Then enter your OU email address.  Check your email (including spam/junk).**  IF YOU STILL can’t log in come to my Zoom student hours.  (If the scheduled times don’t work: on that same Canvas page with info about Zoom Student Hours, there is a link to my calendar so you can schedule a time that works for you!)

### Update your username and avatar ###

3. Once you are LOGGED IN look in the upper left. There is a black menu bar. Hover over “PRIVATE Blog for [class name]… “ next to the big W.  “Dashboard” should appear in a dropdown menu. Click on Dashboard.

6. Under Profile Picture choose your Image

Click "Choose image" and upload a profile picture. This picture will appear alongside your name on the blog. Please pick one that you will be happy with for the semester (or at least for the first several weeks, so we can get to know you.) 

You do not need to show us your face if you don't want to (but you're welcome to!). Just be sure to pick something that you feel represents you well and doesn't violate our course principles.

7. Click the blue “Update Profile” button.

You’re done!
