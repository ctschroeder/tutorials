The creators of Omeka maintain robust [documentation for Omeka online](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/).  You can also visit an online [showcase of projects using Omeka](https://omeka.org/classic/showcase/).

This tutorial is for Omeka classic, not [Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/).

## 1. About Omeka Exhibits

An [Exhibit Buildewr plug-in for Omeka](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Plugins/ExhibitBuilder/) exists.  The Exhibits Builder enables you to curate content as online exhibits, selecting itmes and adding information in a visually pleasing way. You can divide your Exhibit into multiple pages or just have a single page.

I have already activated the plug-in for our Omeka site.  If you are creating your own site:  click on Plugins on the top menu in the administrative back end for your site; locate the Exhibit Builder plugin and click Activate to activate it.

## 2. Conceptualizing your Exhibit(s)

Review the themes and questions we have raised about our text/topic.  

Come up with three possible Exhibits for your group to create; have preliminary titles/topics for these three, and be sure there are Items in our Collections that can address these topics.  (Items can be featured in more than one Exhibit.)

As a class, we will decide on the final Exhibits. In groups working on your assigned Exhibit(s):

•	Write up on a shared document (possibly a Google doc?) the questions and themes related to your exhibit

•	Begin working out which Items might be appropriate for the Exhibit

•	Begin thinking about items you might want in your Exhibit that we don’t HAVE

•	Map out a plan of the Exhibit with pages or subsections (assign a page/subtopic to each person)


## 3. Creating & Designing your Exhibit(s)

Click on Exhibits > Add Exhibit to create your Exhibit – come up with a good title!

In your Exhibit admin, Add a Page for each person in your group

## 4.	Each person in a team is responsible for one Page in the group’s Exhibit

•	You pick the layout for your Page

•	You write the text and add the Items

•	In the text: explain the questions that led you to create this page, why you chose these Items, and how they illustrate your theme and the Acts of Paul and Thecla.

•	If you do conduct research, you must cite and link to the source.  No matter what:  if you take material word for word from somewhere else, you must put those words in quotation marks and give the source.  If you take ideas and/or information from somewhere else (but not word-for-word) you need a citation.

Cite the chapter of the original primary source if you reference our common text.
