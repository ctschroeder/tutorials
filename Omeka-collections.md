## 1. Reviewing Metadata

Keeping in mind what we discussed last time about "Creators", "Publishers", and "Sources", please look at the metadata for a few items. *Are we as a project consistent about what we categorize as a Creator vs Source vs Publisher?*

Now, let's clean up our metadata one last time

•	Description:  This field should contain as much information as possible about the Item being catalogued.  IF YOU TOOK CONTENT WORD-FOR-WORD from the source website of your item, indicate it here.  At the end of the description, put something like “(Description from <Title of source website + link to source website>)” or "(Description from <Source>.)" where <Source> is whatever is in your Source field.
•	Source (link where appropriate and full information — not just the blog where the pic appeared, but if this is a book or an art object, be sure the original source is credited.  USE TWO input fields if necessary.)
•	Creator (be sure this is the creator of the thing being catalogued, not just the person who uploaded the image to the internet)
•	Tags – are they consistent with the tags we are using course-wide/site-wide?

## 2. Create Collections

In class, we will brainstorm possible ways to classify and group our items into "Collections".  Each student or student group will be assigned at least one Collection.

### In the administrative interface, click on Collections on the left menu

### Add Dublin Core metadata for your Collection.

You may not be able to fill out every box; that's ok.  Fill out the following *at minimum*:
  - Title: title of your Collection
  - Subject: brief key word(s) or phrase(s) 
  - Description:  description of the collection
  - Rights: put:  "Consult the Rights for each individual item in this Collection."
  
### Click the box in the upper right to make the Collection Public

## 3. Add Items to Collections

Go back to the list of Items by clicking on Items on the left menu.

Select an Item to add to your Collection.  Click on it.

You'll see a drop-down menu on the right for Collections. Select the Collection you want. Note: Items can only go in one Collection!

Be sure to click Save to save your changes.

## 4. Checking for Orphan Items

When you're done, click on Collections in the left menu. You should see a note on the upper and lower right telling you how many items are NOT in a Collection. 

Click on the highlighted number. Select each item in the list one by one and assign each to a Collection
