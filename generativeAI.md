## Humanities Research with Generative AI ##

### 1. About this Tutorial ###
This tutorial will walk you through two exercises using generative AI for humanities research.
Please keep in mind there are ethical issues with using generative AI:
- the models and apps generate profit for their companies while the training data includes art, writing, code without compensating the original creators
- there is a debate about energy and water usage (here is a [January 2025 MIT article](https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117) on the issue
- low wage workers classify, tag, annotate, or moderate the data
- creating chatbots that talk like another person or group of people can be considered offensive (for example, accusations of digital blackface)

#### Do you want to level up? ####
Because this course includes students of all levels of experience with generative AI models and apps, this tutorial will not be training or customizing our own apps (although that is quite possible to do).
If you have experience programming or training models already, you may choose to train an app for a Humanities research purpose. However, I cannot give you coaching on this. You're on your own. Common trainable apps are:
- Llama
- [Chatdoc](https://chatdoc.com/)
- a ton more

If you choose this option:
1. Be sure you are training your app for a _humanities_ objective
2. Your lab report should
   - explain your humanities objective, what model you trained, what additional documents/sources you used for the training
   - link to/cite all of the above
   - link to the app you created if it's online
   - provide a transcript of some humanities task you asked it to do
   - evaluate the results (accuracy? helpfulness? ethical issues)
