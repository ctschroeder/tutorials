# Linked Open Data and Project Management

## Follow-ups from previous days

[Clerical Exile Project](https://www.dhi.ac.uk/clericalexile/)

[Berkeley prosopographic project](http://berkeleyprosopography.org/)

## Linked Open Data

Thinking about Linked Data
* https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data
* http://5stardata.info/en/
  * 5-star data typically involves rdf (relationships expressed in code)
  * 4-star as simple as licensing, open formats, stable URI's -> doable even for a small project

Linked-data resources/hubs for ancient studies
  * Trismegistos!
  * Papyri.info
  * Pelagios
  * PATHS
  * IIIF standards for images
  * Others?

Do these projects follow linked-open-data practices?  Should they?  Could they?

Why would you want your data to be link-able? How could your project benefit?

How difficult would it be?

### Project Management

We will start by prototyping possible projects
* What is your "dataset"?
  * What state is it in currently?
* What are your research goals and questions?
  * Anything you need to do re formatting/encoding/etc your data?
  * What methods might you need to use, apply to your data set/primary sources to acheive those goals?
  * Are there other projects with similar research questions or sources?  What can you learn from them?
* Given the above:
  * Map out your project process
  * Map out your project goals
  * Map out your project infrastructure
  
We'll present our prototyping to each other.
