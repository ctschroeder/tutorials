# Out of the box tools to get a project online & Introduction to 3d Modeling issues

## CMS and Project Publication Tools
One issue that has come up in our discussions has been how to launch a small project or develop a proof-of-concept that can be presented at conferences and used as a basis for future funding proposals.

Complex projects may require budgeting for a web developer, either to build your web infrastructure (database, interface, etc.) or to customize existing tools, content management systems, etc.

Smaller projects or proof-of-concepts may not require a high level of coding skill, however.

Caveat:  Talk to your libraries and institutional IT about 
* server space availalbe for your project
* archiving faculty/student/staff digital research (how to design for sustainabiiity and preservation)

**_Do this FIRST_** before designing your project
* useful for your project -- they know stuff!
* be respectful of the labor of the librarians and other staff on campus
* you might find collaborators
* I don't know about the European context, but in the US relationships between Library and Research colleagues can be very mutually beneficial when approaching each other as colleagues with mutual interests and can be fraught when one party regards the other as "support" staff or expects free labor

Three ways to easily launch small projects with little to no coding experience are using the following publication platforms or content management systems:
* Wordpress (drives a huge portion of the web); can install on your server or get a free site at Wordpress.org
* [Omeka](http://www.omeka.org/): created by academics, used by libraries, archives, museums, researchers; especially designed for cataloguing and presenting objects in an exhibit format; free & open source.  Host or your own server or on Omeka's at Omeka.net (both free basic & inexpensive larger scale options)
  * Just launched:  new Omeka S for institutions, large projects; see this [tour](http://omeka.org/s/tour/)
* [Scalar](https://scalar.usc.edu/scalar/): created by academics, used by researchers, artists, e-lit authors to present non-linear or interactive web narratives.

## Explore Omeka and Scalar

Spend a few minutes on the following project sites.  What works? What kinds of capabilities do these sites have? What do they excel at? Do you see any drawbacks?

Scalar
* [Newberry Library: Transcribing Faith](http://publications.newberry.org/dig/rc-transcribe/index)
* [Performing Archive](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/performingarchive/index)
* [We are all Children of Algeria](http://scalar.usc.edu/nehvectors/mirzoeff/index)
* [Bernini](http://scalar.usc.edu/hc/caa.reviews-bernini/index)
* If you're interested in Scalar, there's a [showcase of new features](https://scalar.usc.edu/anvc_site/scalar/showcase/)

Omeka
* [Hermoupolis Digital Heritage](http://info.omeka.net/showcase/example/hermoupolis.html): on Omeka's server
* [Committee to Rescue Italian Art](https://cria.itatti.harvard.edu/)
* [DIY History](http://diyhistory.lib.uiowa.edu/)
* More projects in the [showcase](http://omeka.org/classic/showcase/) and online [directory](http://omeka.org/classic/directory/)

### Making our own exhibit

We will spend some time in in the workshop making our own Omeka exhibit on my server. (I am more more familiar with Omeka but I'm willing to try a group-scalar site if that's what you all want to try.)

Our sandbox is at http://omekatest.carrieschroeder.org.  Admin interface is  http://omekatest.carrieschroeder.org/admin

Find/make/download images from our workshops this week
  * your maps and wordclouds
  * images Irene posted to FB
  * anything else?
  
Consider
* Do you have permission to post these?
* What kinds of metadata should you give each object?
* What kind of license should we give our site?

Go to the URL; I'll add you as users

Omeka and Scalar allow you to use their servers to publish your work.  If you want "one-click" installation of Omeka or Scalar, [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/) has fairly inexpensive webhosting.

Use [THIS TUTORIAL](https://github.com/ctschroeder/tutorials/blob/master/add-omeka-items.md) from one of my classes to add objects to our Omeka site.  (MODIFY as necessary)

### Metadata
Stanford Libraries has an extensive [metadata resource](http://library.stanford.edu/research/data-management-services/data-best-practices/creating-metadata)

You will notice that our metadata is INCONSISTENT.  You can install a [plugin to Omeka](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/) to use controlled vocabularies.

### Images

If you are working with images, check out the new [IIIF standards](http://iiif.io/) for image interoperability.  Omeka has a [plugin for IIIF](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/) for IIIF also.

If you are installing Omeka on your own server, you need to follow [these easy instructions to make your images visible](https://community.reclaimhosting.com/t/imagemagick-in-omeka-classic/230)

## 3D Modeling (cultural heritage objects and virtual environments)

### Tools
* Agisoft Photoscan (free version + paid pro version with free trial)
* Capturing Reality https://www.capturingreality.com/ (PC Only)
* Blender https://www.blender.org/
* Unity https://unity3d.com/ (3d game software; gamify your environment)

### Ancient Resources & Examples
Conferences and work related to antiquity
* Tweets from a 3d heritage conference at the [British Museum](https://storify.com/ctschroeder/ipbm3d)
* Conference video (RTI, 3d, etc.) from [Met Museum conference](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/conservation-and-scientific-research/projects/rti-symposium/day-2-pm)

3d Projects/feeds
* [Rita Lucarelli 3d Coffins, Berkeley](http://3dcoffins.berkeley.edu/)
* [British Museum sketchfab channel](https://sketchfab.com/britishmuseum)
* [Rome 320AD](http://www.rome320ad.com/) gamified reconstruction of Rome in 320 AD with characters, interactivity

Other non-ancient sites
* [Soweto 1976](http://www.soweto76archive.org/): created using historical photos and historical archives
* [Little Manila, Stockton](http://littlemanila.digitaldeltas.org/exhibits/show/main/3d-simulation): gamified 3d reconstruction based on historical archival photographs and personal interviews

Discussion of 3d site reconstruction and gamification;
* How to address historical uncertainty?
* How to model "characters" from a different culture speaking in a different language?
* How to create diverse characters?  How many do you need?
* Modeling historical uncertainty -> create MULTIPLE models of an environment, site, pathway
