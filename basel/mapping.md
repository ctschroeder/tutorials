# Day 3: Mapping
## Overview of today
Today we will 
* spend some time on an overview of mapping tools, projects, and gazeteers for the ancient world
* create basic maps in Google maps and other tools using existing non-ancient spreadsheet data
* community source maps and spreadsheet data using ancient data and tools/projects for antiquity we have examined
* discuss the limitations of geographical mapping for spatial research (e.g., what about places we cannot map onto a site?)



## Mapping Tools, Projects, and Gazeteers
### Sample list
* [Orbis](http://orbis.stanford.edu/) - click on "Using" for instructions/tutorial, or just play around with it
* [Pelagios](http://commons.pelagios.org/) - linked data hub for ancient mapping/geographical study (aggregates data from other sites)
* [Recogito](http://recogito.pelagios.org/) - tool for annotating text and images with geographic data
* [Pleiades](https://pleiades.stoa.org/) - ancient world gazetteer (aggregates data from other sites, mostly through Pelagios)
* [Antiquity a la carte map creator](http://awmc.unc.edu/awmc/applications/alacarte/)
* [Syriaca gazetteer for places mentioned in Syriac literature](http://syriaca.org/geo/index.html)
* [QGIS]() - open source mapping software; powerful; not specifically for antiquity
* [Harvard World Maps]() - open source mapping software; powerful; not specifically for antiquity
* [Google tables]() - create maps using spreadsheet data & Google fusion tables
* [Carto DB]() - commercial mapping tool with free scaled down option; not specifically for antiquity
* [Tableau]() - commercial mapping and data visualization tool; not specifically for antiquity

### Step 1: [Orbis](http://orbis.stanford.edu/)
Spend some time playing with Orbis to calculate routes in the ancient world.  The About page will tell you more about the data sources.

Map a route from your favorite city to Rome or Alexandria
*  What does the route look like in different seasons?
*  Is the cheapest route the same as the fastest route?  Is the fastest route the same as the shortest route?
*  Pretend you get seasick:  omit the Open Sea from your route.  
*  Pretend you get really really seasick: omit the Open Sea and the Coastal Sea from your route
*  Make sure the bottom pane is open: Look in the bottom pane for information about how much it costs and the methods to get from one place to another (I believe dark blue is open sea, light blue river, green coastal sea, brownish road)
*  Minimize the bottom pane -- play around with the modes of travel

**Pro tip**:  Orbis layers one route on top of the next in your map.  Click reset map on the right to clear it.**

Click on "Network"
*  Choose fastest, cheapest, or shortest
*  Calculate Network -- see how the cities on the map are shaded based on the cost (in terms of distance, time, $)
*  Make sure the bottom pane is open:  Click on Cartogram (not in Distance network but in others) -- what happens?  Click on Zones -- what happens?

To my knowledge, you can download an SVG file (can only be opened in certain programs, doesn't contain map tiles background) or take a screenshot

### Step 2: Visit [Pleiades](https://pleiades.stoa.org/) and [Pelagios](http://commons.pelagios.org/)
Search in Pleiades for your favorite places
*  What's easy or difficult about the search?
*  Look for common and not so common places -- how much information about these places is there?
*  Where is the data coming from for these places?
*  What else interesting do you notice about the data?

What is Pelagios?  Anything you could use it for?
*  Explore data > Roman map  Check out the Roman empire map.  How could this be useful?
*  Linked Data > Search Peripleo:  Search Peripleo for one of the places you searched Pleiades.  What's similar and different about the results?
*  How might you use a linked data hub for a project?

If you're interested in a background map tile, you can check out the [Roman Empire map tiles](http://commons.pelagios.org/2012/09/a-digital-map-of-the-roman-empire/)

### Step 4:  Visit [Syriaca.org Gazetteer](http://syriaca.org/geo/index.html)
What is this?

Search for a site -- what information is there, where is it from?

How did they build the gazetter?

Could this be a model for other projects?

### Step 5:  Make a map using [Antiquity a la carte map creator](http://awmc.unc.edu/awmc/applications/alacarte/)
This map like many map services uses *layers*: you have base terrain or road layers, and then you layer on top more information -- each kind getting its own layer.

First play around:
*  Map layers:  Check and uncheck boxes especially in Cultural data > physical culture and political areas and physical data
*  Search for features
  * Before you click on the button, be sure Features is selected in the Physical Culture layer, otherwise you can't add it to a map
  * Search for a TYPE of place -- I tried "monastery" ... which had an interesting result
  * Search for major named place, such as Antioch -- what do you notice about the results?
    * Add one of your results to the map
    * For Antioch, can you add all the results to the map or not?  Why?

Make the map the way you want it to look, with the layers you want and features you want.

Under File, export it or save the URL to your map so you can use it later

### Step 6:  Geotag a text using Recogito
