# Tutorial on Uploading your files to your server space at OU

## About files and servers

For people to be able to see your files, such as your HTML files you created in [the HTML tutorial](https://github.com/ctschroeder/tutorials/blob/master/html_css_workshop/HTML_Tutorial.md), you need to put them on a server on the web. Fortunately, you have access to server space through the OU Create program. This tutorial will show you how to create a subdomain and put your files in a public folder for the world to see.

## 1. Create a Subdomain on your OU Create Account

We are going to create a separate space on your OU Create Account for these files.  We are going to keep them separate from your main website, so there is no confusion about which is your main blog/website and which is this sub-project. To do this, we'll create a subdomain. You've seen subdomains before -- the "dh2020" in the course website dh2020.carrieschroeder.net is a subdomain.  You can create more websites and projects on your domain by using subdomains.

First login at [OU Create](https://create.ou.edu/) as you always do. You will then see the control panel (CPanel) for your OU Create account

Look in the Domains section and click on Subdomains:
