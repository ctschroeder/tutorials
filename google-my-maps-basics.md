# Google My Maps Basics Tutorial

This tutorial will show you how to upload a spreadsheet of georeferenced data to create a custom map in Google Maps.

It works best in the CHROME browser.

## 1. Upload Your Data

## 2. Select Labels for Your Markers

## 3. Customize your markers

## 4. Add images to your pop-up windows

## 5. Publish your map if you want to share it

Click "Share" to publish your map.  

 - If you only want people with a direct link to view it, choose that option.  You can send the public link to your friends.

 - If you want to embed your map into a website, you must make it public for everyone to view.

Select your option. 

Be sure to provide a good description and title for your map -- including a description of and link to your dataset!!!

Then click "Preview" to see the version your friends or the public will see.

## 6. Embed the map

You can always take a screenshot of the map and link to the live version on Google.

You also can embed the map.  Click on "Share" in the public map for options to tweet it, facebook it, or embed it.
